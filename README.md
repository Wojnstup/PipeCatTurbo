  </p>
  
  <h3 color="#c4037a">How does it work?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The local playlists are stored in ~/.pipecat_turbo_lists file</li>
    <li>When launched, mpv creates a /tmp/mpvsocket file, so you can controll it or extract info from it with bash commands</li>
    <li>While playing playlists, the script creates a /tmp/pipecat_list file, so you can move forward or backwards in your queue</li>
    <li>All the info and videos are scraped from an <a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">Invidious</a> instance somebody hosted, so you don't ping Google wihle being able to access all the Youtube content</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 color="#c4037a">Config and hacking?</h3>
  <p align="center">
    The script doesn't have a config file by default. If you want to create a config file, you do it in <span color="#c4037a">~/.config/pipecat_turbo.conf</span><br>
  The rest is explained in the comments in the script. 
</p>  

<h3 color="#c4037a">Example config - it's the one I use!</h3>
